# military_expenditures

In this project, I experimented with creating dashboards, plotly and flask. The required packages can be seen in requirements.txt.

The app is hosted on heroku: https://milexp-topr.herokuapp.com/

The data can be found here:
- Presidents: https://www.kaggle.com/harshitagpt/us-presidents?select=us_presidents.csv
- Military Expenditures: https://www.kaggle.com/nitinsss/military-expenditure-of-countries-19602019
- Conflicts: https://www.infoplease.com/history/us/major-military-operations-since-world-war-ii
- Import/Export/GDB https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPRT.KD

The template of the application was provided to me by udacity in the course of the data science nanodegree.
